If your matrix is stored in the column-major order, change the 5th argument to -1 when calling CKTSO(_L)_Analyze to use the transposed mode. Note: in the transposed mode, the L2NormOfResidual function provided in demo.cpp and demo_l.cpp will not get correct residual as it is for row-major matrices.
