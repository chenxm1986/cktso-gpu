CKTSO-GPU: GPU-based Sparse Solver Accelerator for Circuit Simulation
============

CKTSO-GPU is a **GPU acceleration** module of [CKTSO](https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso), a high-performance parallel sparse direct solver specially designed for SPICE-based circuit simulation. CKTSO-GPU provides acceleration for LU re-factorization and forward/backward substitutions for slightly-dense circuit matrices, by using CUDA.

CKTSO-GPU supports both real and complex matrices. Both row and column modes are supported.

Please read "ug.pdf" for more information about the usage of this package. Read "howto.txt" to see how to compile and run the demos.
